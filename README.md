## Description

So_Long is a project developed as part of the curriculum at 42, it is a 2D game built using the MinilibX (or in my case the [MLX42](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42)) graphics library. 
In the mandatory part, the objective of the game is to navigate through a map, collecting items to reach the exit. For the bonus part, the player should avoid an enemy patrol and lose if they are touched. Animations sprites should also be added,
and the total movement count should be displayed directly on the game window rather than just in the shell. 

## Installation

To run So_Long, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.

`git clone https://github.com/sdemaude/so_long.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory.

`cd so_long`

3. Compile the project.

`make`

4. Run the game with a map file as argument.

`./so_long <map-file>`

>Replace `<map-file>` with the path to the map file you want to play.

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys or the `W`,`S`,`A`,`D` keys to move the player character (up, down, left, right).
- Press `ESC` to exit the game.

## Gameplay

1. Upon starting the game, you'll be placed in the map environment.
2. Navigate through the map using the direction keys.
3. Collect all items and avoid the ennemy if there is one.
4. Reach the exit to complete the level.

## Cheatcode

If you haven't collected all the items but reach the exit, simply press `4`, `2`, and `Enter` keys together to win instantly !
